Difficult parts:
- getting text in the right form, dealing with whitespace and missing data appropriately
- getting the direct download link with the large size
- of course everything needs to be in the right directory structure,
and I had left mine over from the previous webapp which made it not work
- changing everything to receive text data would have been impossible without templates


Places where things went wrong:
- don't understand why blank.csv needs to have the structure it does
- don't understand why the directory structure I did have (with all the
app files in the zeit directory) didn't work

- for heroku app, there were some parts I didn't do at first -- scaling the app in particular -- could be why it didn't work at first
