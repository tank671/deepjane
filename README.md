# deepjane

Automatic text generation in the style of Jane Austen.

The model is an AWD-LSTM, pretrained on a subset of English Wikipedia (https://www.sysml.cc/doc/50.pdf)
and fine-tuned on Jane Austen's complete works, downloaded from Project Gutenberg (http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31100).

The text generator is online at https://deepjane.now.sh, and also tweets periodically at https://twitter.com/AutoAusten
