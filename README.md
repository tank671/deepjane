# deepjane

Generates text in the style of Jane Austen.

The project uses the fastai library (all steps to generate the model are in the jupyter notebook).  I used a model pre-trained on the WikiText-103 dataset (https://www.sysml.cc/doc/50.pdf) and fine-tuned on Austen's complete works from the Gutenberg Project.  The resulting app is available on zeit at https://deepjane.now.sh
